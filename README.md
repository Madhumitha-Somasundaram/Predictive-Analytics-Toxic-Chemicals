# Predictive Analysis of Toxic Chemical Releases
Analyzing EPA Datasets to Predict Future Toxic Chemical Releases

# Overview
This project focuses on processing and analyzing toxic chemical release data using Python. The workflow involves cleaning and transforming raw datasets, mapping codes to meaningful labels, performing visualizations, and building predictive models to forecast toxic emissions over the next five years.
